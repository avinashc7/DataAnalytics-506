# The following table shows the results of a survey of 10 pirates. In addition to some basic demographic information, the survey asked each pirate "What is your favorite superhero?" and "How many tattoos do you have?"

# 2. What is the median age of the 10 pirates?

# 3. What was the mean age of female and male pirates separately?

# 4. What was the most number of tattoos owned by a male pirate?

# 5. What percent of pirates under the age of 32 were female?

# 6. What percent of female pirates are under the age of 32?

# 7. Add a new column to the dataframe called tattoos.per.year which shows how many tattoos each pirate has for each year in their life.

# 8. Which pirate had the most number of tattoos per year?

# 9. What are the names of the female pirates whose favorite superhero is Superman?
piratesurvey$name[with(piratesurvey, sex == "F" & superhero == "Superman")]

# 10. What was the median number of tattoos of pirates over the age of 20 whose favorite superhero is Spiderman?
